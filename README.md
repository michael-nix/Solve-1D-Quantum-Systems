This app provides basic functionality to simulate and analyze one-dimensional time-dependent quantum systems. The ultimate goal is to calculate the energies of the stationary states of a scalar potential simply by watching how the wave function evolves in time. It includes pre-defined scalar potentials for well-known problems that also have analytic solutions, as well as a couple of other simple systems I've seen floating around and solved, e.g., via eigenvalue calculations. It's also possible to customize scalar potentials in a few different ways; and, similarly for a basic magnetic field.

If you just want to see how it works, you can just run MainQuantumSolverUI, use the default settings, navigate to the Simulation tab and hit the start button to run a straightforward simulation: the quantum harmonic oscillator.
